Assignment:
The purpose of this programming project is to demonstrate understanding of 2 dimensional arrays and the creation, implementation, 
and use of a simple class. You are to design a class “LostPuppy.java” which represents a puppy lost in a multi-floor building that 
contains the same number of rooms on each floor. During instantiation (or creation) of an object of this class, each room on each floor
will be initialized as empty (you will actually use the space ‘ ‘ character for this purpose) and a random room will be chosen where the 
puppy is lost. For this purpose, the character “P” will be placed in this random location. Further details on the constructor is listed 
below. An object of this class is used as a game for two players to take turns searching for the puppy, one room at a time until the 
unfortunate little canine is found. The instantiation of this object and the search will be performed by a “driver” program which has 
been provided to you allowing you to only have to concentrate on developing the class (the driver program is in the file “PuppyPlay.java”)
